Below is a high-level summary of the critical issues and files to investigate or modify. Focus is on the following recurring errors:

1. **Supabase RLS Policy Failure**  
   *Error:* `new row violates row-level security policy for table "users"`
   - This indicates your insert or update request does not satisfy the RLS policies in the **users** table, particularly that `auth.uid() = id`.

2. **Missing Database Column**  
   *Error:* `"Could not find the 'last_error' column of 'users' in the schema cache"`
   - The code references `last_error` in the `profileService` but that column does not exist in the **public.users** table schema from your migrations.

3. **Undefined Function**  
   *Error:* `_profileService.profileService.updateHealthMetrics is not a function`
   - You are calling `profileService.updateHealthMetrics(...)` but the file `@src/features/profile/services/profileService.ts` does not define such a method.

4. **SecureStore Warning**  
   *Warning:* `Value being stored in SecureStore is larger than 2048 bytes ...`
   - This is an Expo SecureStore limitation. You may need to store large tokens or sessions in smaller chunks or switch to an alternative storage solution if you exceed 2 KB.

## Areas & Files to Address

### 1. Supabase RLS Policy for "@src/features/profile/services/profileService.ts"

- **Policies** are defined in your migration scripts:
  
  **@supabase/migrations/20250118125500_simplified_schema.sql**  
  ```sql
  CREATE POLICY "Users can read their own profile"
      ON public.users FOR SELECT
      TO authenticated
      USING (auth.uid() = id);

  CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile"
      ON public.users FOR UPDATE
      TO authenticated
      USING (auth.uid() = id);

If the app is inserting a brand-new row for a user whose UUID does not match auth.uid(), that insert is blocked. For a newly signed-up user, the id in users must match the ID from auth.uid().

Check that your profileService.createProfile() call is including the correct id: user.id. If you are using supabase.auth.getUser() or the session user, ensure that is set as the primary key in the request. If not, the row won’t pass the USING (auth.uid() = id) condition.

2. Missing last_error Field in Table “users”
	•	The logs show repeated attempts to updateProfile(currentUser.id, { last_error: ... }), but your migrations define only these columns:

CREATE TABLE public.users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    display_name TEXT,
    photo_url TEXT,
    device_info JSONB,
    permissions_granted BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
    deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    score INT4
);

There’s no last_error field. This mismatch triggers the PGRST204 error about the missing column.

	•	Solution
	1.	Add the last_error column to the users table in your migrations if you want to store an error message:

ALTER TABLE public.users
ADD COLUMN last_error TEXT;  -- or another suitable type


	2.	Or Remove the code referencing last_error inside @src/features/profile/services/profileService.ts and other places that update or select it.

3. “profileService.updateHealthMetrics” Missing
	•	There’s a reference to _profileService.profileService.updateHealthMetrics in logs:

ERROR  Failed to sync with database: [TypeError: _profileService.profileService.updateHealthMetrics is not a function (it is undefined)]


	•	@src/features/profile/services/profileService.ts does not define a method called updateHealthMetrics. It only has createProfile, getProfile, updateProfile, etc.
	•	Action
	•	Implement a new method named updateHealthMetrics(userId, metrics) if that is desired. For instance:

// @src/features/profile/services/profileService.ts
async updateHealthMetrics(userId: string, metrics: Partial<HealthMetrics>) {
  // Insert or upsert logic goes here, possibly referencing the 'health_metrics' table
  // or just updating the 'users' table if you want to store aggregated metrics.
}


	•	Or remove that call from your code if it’s unnecessary.

4. SecureStore Size Limit
	•	The warnings:

WARN  Value being stored in SecureStore is larger than 2048 bytes ...

	•	Expo SecureStore on iOS can silently fail if you exceed 2 KB. Potential solutions:
	1.	Store smaller data – e.g. only store tokens, not entire user objects.
	2.	Implement a custom storage approach (e.g. AsyncStorage for bigger data).
	3.	Break large items into multiple smaller entries.

Proposed Fixes & Next Steps
	1.	Add or Remove the last_error Column
	•	If you need that field to log error text, run a new migration:

ALTER TABLE public.users ADD COLUMN last_error TEXT;


	•	Then push your changes to ensure PostgREST knows the column.
	•	Otherwise, remove last_error references in @src/features/profile/services/profileService.ts.

	2.	Review the RLS Insert
	•	Ensure your profileService.createProfile(...) sets the row user id to match the current auth.uid().
	•	If your new users table row is failing RLS, confirm that the data uses the same UUID from the Auth system.
	3.	Implement updateHealthMetrics (if used)
	•	If your HealthKit or Google Connect data should be stored in “health_metrics” instead of “users”, add a function to the profile service or a new “metrics” service:

// Example code to upsert metrics
async updateHealthMetrics(userId: string, newMetrics: Partial<HealthMetrics>) {
  return await supabase
    .from('health_metrics')
    .upsert([{ user_id: userId, ...newMetrics }]);
}


	•	Then call profileService.updateHealthMetrics(userId, healthMetrics) from your Apple/Google provider sync.

	4.	SecureStore
	•	If your session or user object is too large, store only critical token data in SecureStore. For example:

// Only store a short JWT token, not the entire user session

Primary Files to Modify or Create

Modify
	•	@supabase/migrations/20250118125500_simplified_schema.sql
If you want to add last_error or adjust RLS logic.
	•	@src/features/profile/services/profileService.ts
	1.	Remove or add logic referencing last_error.
	2.	Possibly add updateHealthMetrics(...) method.
	•	@src/features/profile/hooks/useProfile.ts
Remove calls to updateHealthMetrics or handle new method usage if it’s introduced.
	•	@src/health-metrics/hooks/useHealthData.ts or similar**
Check references to updateHealthMetrics or references to a missing column.

Potential New File (Optional)
	•	@src/features/profile/services/healthMetricsService.ts
If you prefer a dedicated service for metrics insertion, separate from users operations.

Example: Adding last_error Column

-- In a new migration file:
ALTER TABLE public.users
ADD COLUMN last_error TEXT;

Then you can do:

// @src/features/profile/services/profileService.ts
try {
  // ... initialization logic
} catch (error) {
  await supabase.from('users').update({ last_error: error.message }).eq('id', userId);
}

Development Workflow
	1.	Create or update your Supabase migrations to match the usage in your code (add last_error if needed).
	2.	Sync the migrations to your local DB or your hosted Supabase instance.
	3.	Verify that the RLS policy matches how you insert new users. The (auth.uid() = id) check requires the new row’s id to match the authenticated user’s supabase.auth user ID.
	4.	Implement or remove updateHealthMetrics(...).
	5.	Test on iOS simulator, re-run yarn expo start --clear, fix any lingering references or type mismatch errors.

Remember that each step in your pipeline must be consistent between the code that references columns (like last_error) and your Supabase schema. With the above changes, you should no longer see the row-level security violation or missing column error.
