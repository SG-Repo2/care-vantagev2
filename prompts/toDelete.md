## Files to Delete
The following files can be safely removed as their functionality has been consolidated in the health-metrics module:

1. Legacy Health Context:
   - src/core/contexts/health/* (replaced by src/health-metrics/contexts/HealthDataContext.tsx)
   - src/features/health/* (consolidated in health-metrics module)

2. Deprecated Provider Implementations:
   - src/core/health/* (replaced by src/health-metrics/providers/*)
   - src/features/health/providers/* (replaced by new provider factory pattern)

3. Old Test Files:
   - src/features/health/tests/* (replaced by new integration tests)
   - src/core/contexts/health/__tests__/* (replaced by new test suite)

4. Utility Files:
   - src/utils/health/* (functionality moved to health-metrics/utils)
   - src/core/utils/health-transforms.ts (logic now in health-metrics services)

5. Core Module Files:
   - src/core/auth/* (consolidate with src/health-metrics/core/auth/)
   - src/core/database/* (remove in favor of direct Supabase client usage)
   - src/core/error/ErrorBoundary.tsx (move to src/health-metrics/core/error/)
   - src/core/storage/StorageService.ts (consolidate with health-metrics services)
   - src/core/supabase/* (use centralized client from src/utils/supabase.ts)
   - src/core/types/* (consolidate with src/health-metrics/types.ts)
   - src/core/utils/* (migrate useful utilities to src/health-metrics/utils/)
   - src/core/constants/* (move to src/health-metrics/config/)

## Next Steps
1. Database Migration:
   - Apply new migration for user profile trigger
   - Verify automatic profile creation
   - Test auth flow end-to-end
   - Verify data integrity

2. Dependency Cleanup:
   - Remove bull from package.json
   - Remove express-rate-limit from package.json
   - Clean up any remaining server-side dependencies
   - Run yarn install to update lockfile

3. Feature Flag Rollout:
   - Enable monitoring for all users
   - Gradually enable offline sync (25% rollout)
   - Test provider integration with small user group
   - Verify client-side rate limiting

4. Performance Monitoring:
   - Set up analytics dashboard
   - Configure alerting thresholds
   - Monitor error rates
   - Track auth flow success rates

5. Documentation:
   - Update API documentation
   - Add migration guide
   - Document rollback procedures
   - Document auth flow changes

6. Validation:
   - Run full test suite
   - Verify multi-device sync
   - Test offline functionality
   - Validate provider integrations
   - Test auth flow with various providers

7. Core Module Migration:
   - Move ErrorBoundary to health-metrics while preserving functionality
   - Update all imports to use centralized Supabase client
   - Migrate useful utilities and constants
   - Remove complex database abstraction layer
   - Test all features after migration
   - Update documentation to reflect new structure
   - Verify error handling across the application
   - Clean up any remaining unused imports
