## Files to Delete
The following files can be safely removed as their functionality has been consolidated in the health-metrics module:

1. Legacy Health Context:
   - src/core/contexts/health/* (replaced by src/health-metrics/contexts/HealthDataContext.tsx)
   - src/features/health/* (consolidated in health-metrics module)

2. Deprecated Provider Implementations:
   - src/core/health/* (replaced by src/health-metrics/providers/*)
   - src/features/health/providers/* (replaced by new provider factory pattern)

3. Old Test Files:
   - src/features/health/tests/* (replaced by new integration tests)
   - src/core/contexts/health/__tests__/* (replaced by new test suite)

4. Utility Files:
   - src/utils/health/* (functionality moved to health-metrics/utils)
   - src/core/utils/health-transforms.ts (logic now in health-metrics services)

## Next Steps

   - Run schema creation scripts
   - Verify data integrity
   - Create performance indices

2. Feature Flag Rollout:
   - Enable monitoring for all users
   - Gradually enable offline sync (25% rollout)
   - Test provider integration with small user group

3. Performance Monitoring:
